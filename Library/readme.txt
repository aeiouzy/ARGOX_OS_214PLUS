Notice:
  How to choose 32-bit library or 64-bit library?
  Please check your application if you select "32-bit or 64-bit of CPU" to compile, 
  and then select the same bits library as your application.
  For example : 
  Select 32-bit CPU to compile => use 32-bit library in the folder, ".\PPLX\Library\32-bit".
  Select 64-bit CPU to compile => use 64-bit library in the folder, ".\PPLX\Library\64-bit".

  If you use C#, VB.NET ... languages (those use .NET Framework library) to develop and 
  select "AnyCPU" to compile, 
  then select the same bits library as your OS.
  For example : 
  Working on 32-bit OS => use 32-bit library in the folder, ".\PPLX\Library\32-bit".
  Working on 64-bit OS => use 64-bit library in the folder, ".\PPLX\Library\64-bit".
